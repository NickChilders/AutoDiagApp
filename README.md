# Getting Started

Clone the repository:<br>
```
git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git
```
Replace "username" with your GitHub username and "repository" with the name of the repository you created.<br>
<br>
Move into the cloned repository:<br>
```
cd <repository>
```
Replace "repository" with the name of the repository you created.<br>
<br>
To ensure you have the latest version of the code, pull any changes made to the repository:<br>
```
git pull origin master
```
This will pull the latest changes made to the "master" branch of the repository.<br>
If you want to update your local repository with any further changes made to the remote repository in the future, you can simply run the same `git pull` command again.<br>


# Before starting make sure you have all dependencies installed.
### Follow these steps to do so:
You need to have node.js and npm installed on your machine.<br>
In order to install Node.js and npm on your machine you can use the instructions found here:<br>
https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
<br>
<br>
Once you have installed Node.js and npm and you have all code files on your machine, you must now add the dependencies.<br>
run the following command:<br>
```
npm install
```
<br>
Now you should be able to run npm start successfully.<br>

### Note:
You must have the server code running in a separate terminal in order to run the app properly.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
